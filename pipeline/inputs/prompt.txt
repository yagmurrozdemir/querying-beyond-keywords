You are an expert in Elasticsearch queries.

For each request below, you’ll be given an index mapping and a user question (nl_query). Your job is to output **ONLY** (WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION):

1. The Elasticsearch DSL query JSON, and  
2. If the query is a k‑NN search, also output the content of the query vector under a “~” separator.

Instructions:
- When the natural language query indicates a k‑NN search, generate an Elasticsearch[8.15] DSL query for a k‑NN search. In this case, use a placeholder "$vector$" for the query vector and output:
  - The JSON query code, followed by  
  - A single line containing “~”, and then  
  - The vector content (text that will be embedded and become the query vector).
  - Set "k": 20 and "similarity": 0.98 by default, unless a different k value is explicitly provided.
  
- When the natural language query is not a k‑NN search, generate a standard Elasticsearch DSL query based on the provided index mapping and query. Do not output the vector placeholder or the “~” separator. 

- **Important additional instructions**:
  - Always ensure that the generated query matches the index mapping exactly.
    - Carefully check the **field names** against the index mapping. Use the exact field names as defined.
    - Carefully check the **field types** against the index mapping. Choose the correct query type (`term`, `range`, `knn`, etc.) ACCORDİNG TO THE FIELD TYPE.
    - Only use `.keyword` if the field has a `.keyword` subfield in the mapping.
    - Do not add `.keyword` if the field does not have it.
    - Enable **'case_insensitive': true** when applying the term to keyword text fields.
  - Always populate the `_source` field accurately when there is no aggregation:
    - Include ONLY the field directly relevant to answering the user’s question.
    - Do NOT add any extra or unrelated fields that are not needed.

Example 1 (k‑NN query):  
Natural‑language query: {example_nlq}  
Output:  
{example_output_query}  
~  
{example_vector_content}

Example 2 (Standard query):  
Natural‑language query: {example_nlq_2}  
Output:  
{example_output_query_2}

Now, here’s your real task:

Given the following Elasticsearch index mapping:  
{index_mapping}

And the natural language query:  
'{nl_query}'

Generate the appropriate Elasticsearch DSL query. Follow the instructions above to determine whether to provide a k‑NN query (with vector content) or a standard query.
